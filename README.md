## abstract

The composition of the gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), and the ability of this microbial community to influence the host, remains uncertain. To achieve a broader understanding of the role of the intestinal microbiota in patients with AN, we collected fecal samples before and following clinical therapy at two geographically distinct eating disorder units (Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders [UNC-CH] and ACUTE Center for Eating Disorders [Denver Health]). Microbiotas were characterized in patients with AN, before and after inpatient treatment, and in non-eating disorder (non-ED) controls using whole genome shotgun sequencing. The impact of inpatient treatment on the AN gut microbiota was remarkably consistent between eating disorder units. Although weight in patients with AN showed improvements, AN microbiotas post-treatment remained distinct from non-ED controls. Additionally, AN gut microbiotas prior to treatment exhibited more fermentation pathways and a lower ability to degrade carbohydrates than non-ED controls. As the intestinal microbiota can influence nutrient metabolism, our data highlight the complex microbial communities in patients with AN as an element needing further attention post inpatient treatment. Additionally, this study defines the effects of renourishment on the AN gut microbiota and serves as a platform to develop precision nutrition approaches to potentially mitigate impediments to recovery.
